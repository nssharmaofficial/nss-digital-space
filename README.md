# My digital space

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c0712884-e5f4-44a0-9299-33164068755f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/nssharma/deploys)

In today's crowded digital world, I wanted to create a place that feels like mine — personal, creative, and reflective of who I am. That's how this website came to be.

## Why `nss-digital-space`?

It captures the idea of an open, adaptable environment where anything can happen. It’s a place where I can explore, experiment, and share everything from professional projects to creative ideas. This flexibility is important to me because my interests and experiences are diverse. "Digital space" gives me the freedom to grow in any direction I choose, without being limited by a specific theme or concept.

## Installation

Even though this is my personal website, I encourage other people to create their own space, so you are free to fork this repo. As it might be overwhelming to setup everything I wrote an [Installation and Deploy Guide](./INSTALLATION.md) that you can follow. I hope that it will be helpful.

If you find it helpful I will be glad for your support.
